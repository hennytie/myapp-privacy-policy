    <h1>MyApp Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>MyApp uses Google Crashlytics and Analytics to help me fix bugs, and to learn where my users are and how many there are. All data is anonymous and location information is approximate.</p>
    <p>That's pretty well it - it requires no permissions at all, no sign-in, no personal information.</p>
    <p>If you think I have missed something out, please let me know.</p>
